**[0:00-0:15] Intro**
(Visual: Title Slide, then face camera)
"Hi, we are Team [Name], and we're tackling the silent epidemic in education: Student Burnout. We built the first AI system that doesn't just track stress—it predicts it."

**[0:15-0:45] The Problem & Persona**
(Visual: Screen recording of a student looking stressed, then switching to the App Splash Screen)
"Meet Alex. It's mid-terms week. Alex is pulling all-nighters. Usually, no one notices until Alex fails a test or has a breakdown. But Alex has our app."

**[0:45-1:30] Core Flow - Data Input & Risk**
(Visual: App Dashboard. Click 'Daily Check-in')
"Alex opens the app. The UI is clean, calming—built with Flutter.
He logs his sleep: 4 hours.
He writes a quick journal: 'I feel completely overwhelmed.'
In the background, our Azure OpenAI model analyzes this text. It detects 'High Anxiety' and 'Exhaustion'.
Combined with the structured data, our Azure ML model calculates a real-time Burnout Risk Score."

**[1:30-2:00] The Prediction & Suggestion**
(Visual: The 'Burnout Meter' animates to Red/High)
"Look at the dashboard. The meter hits 'High Risk'.
But we don't just show a scary number. The AI generating a personalized intervention using GPT-4o.
It says: 'Alex, your cognitive load is peaking. We recommend a 90-minute study break and prioritizing sleep tonight. Here is a 10-minute wind-down guide.'"

**[2:00-2:30] Institutional View & Closing**
(Visual: Power BI Dashboard)
"For the university, this data aggregates into the Admin Dashboard. They can see that the Engineering department is at critical risk this week and can adjust deadlines.
This is the future of learning—sustainable, data-driven, and human-centric. Thank you."
